            <p class="description">
                The 1925 novel The Great Gatsby by F.Scott Fitzgerald is a romance turned tragic. In this novel, the
                reader is Nick Carraway, a new resident in West Egg during the Jazz age. He finds himself becoming
                friends with his millionaire neighbor Jay Gatsby who throws luxurious parties in hopes his long lost
                love Daisy Buchanan would arrive. Looking through the lens from Nick Carraway, the reader sees how
                relationship between Daisy and Gatsby unfold.
